    "### Supervised vs Unsuperivsed Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question I asked myself was should I use supervised or unsupervised techinques. To a large extent I like the certaininty of supervised techinque. There are verifiable model metrics that explicitly inform of me my success or failure. But would slapping on some labled really help me understand the true nature of the data? Below is my thought process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Advantages of Supervised Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Results are directly interpretable since each class has a known real-world meaning\n",
    "- Can leverage existing domain expertise through the labeling process\n",
    "- Performance can be quantitatively validated against ground truth\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Advantages of Unsupervised Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can discover novel patterns that weren't previously known or considered\n",
    "- Can analyze the complete dataset without being limited by label availability\n",
    "- Not limited by the potential quality issues or obtuseness of labels\n",
    "\n",
    "An unsupervised learning approach lets the data tell its own story. Rather than forcing the data into predefined boxes, we're letting the model make its own findings, discovering the true nature of contend of the data in ADSB records.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Having decided to use unsupervised techinques, I now needed to choose which one(s). I really wanted something that would detect subtle variations in flight traces and that would not only be able to truly process high level data aggregations. At the same time, I want something that was performant or at least could be well optimized given the right hardware. My first priority though was really getting choosing a model that would get into the data, and if the outputs would be that much better I would be willing to make some performance trade-offs. Even though this is an academic project, I always keep model performance in mind because I want to get the most experience possible with models that make sense to deploy on real world problems ata production scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here were the options I considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Machine Learning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional Clustering (K-means/DBSCAN)\n",
    "  - Pros:\n",
    "    - Computationally efficient and easy to implement\n",
    "    - Very interpretable results with clear cluster centroids\n",
    "    - Minimal hyperparameter tuning needed compared to deep learning approaches\n",
    "  - Cons:\n",
    "    - Cannot naturally handle temporal aspects of flight data\n",
    "    - Struggles with variable-density clusters of flight patterns\n",
    "    - No inherent mechanism for anomaly detection\n",
    "- Isolation Forest\n",
    "  - Pros:\n",
    "  - Specifically designed for anomaly detection\n",
    "    - Computationally efficient even with large datasets\n",
    "    - Works well with high-dimensional flight data\n",
    "  - Cons:\n",
    "    - No clustering capability for normal flight patterns\n",
    "    - Cannot capture temporal relationships in data\n",
    "    - Limited interpretability of why something is classified as anomalous\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic Models \n",
    "\n",
    "- Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)\n",
    "  - Pros:\n",
    "    - Naturally models flight phase transitions\n",
    "    - Computationally efficient once trained\n",
    "    - Very interpretable state transitions\n",
    "  - Cons:\n",
    "    - Struggles with continuous, high-dimensional flight data\n",
    "    - Limited ability to detect subtle anomalies\n",
    "    - Can be biased by initial state assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- Autoencoder + HDBSCAN\n",
    "  - Pros:\n",
    "    - Simultaneously learns normal flight patterns while providing rich anomaly detection through reconstruction error\n",
    "    - Produces interpretable latent space representations that help explain both clusters and anomalies\n",
    "    - Can detect both global pattern deviations and local anomalies (like sudden accelerations) in a single model\n",
    "  - Cons:\n",
    "    - Requires significant tuning of both autoencoder architecture and HDBSCAN parameters\n",
    "    - May overfit to common flight patterns if training data isn't sufficiently diverse\n",
    "    - Computationally intensive during training phase compared to traditional methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- GANs\n",
    "  - Pros:\n",
    "    - Can learn very subtle deviations from normal flight patterns\n",
    "    - Particularly good at handling multimodal distributions in flight behaviors\n",
    "    - Can generate synthetic examples to help validate anomaly detection\n",
    "  - Cons:\n",
    "    - Notoriously difficult to train and achieve stable convergence\n",
    "  - Much higher computational overhead than other approaches\n",
    "    - May suffer from mode collapse, missing important but rare flight patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "- LSTM-based approaches\n",
    "  - Pros:\n",
    "    - Naturally handles temporal dependencies in flight patterns\n",
    "    - Excellent at predicting expected behavior sequences\n",
    "    - Can capture long-term dependencies in flight phases\n",
    "  - Cons:\n",
    "    - Tends to focus on global patterns, potentially missing local anomalies\n",
    "    - Memory requirements scale with sequence length\n",
    "    - Can be biased toward more common flight patterns, potentially normalizing subtle anomalies\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it would probably be interesting to apply all of the models listed above, the becase of the scope of this project (and the fact that I sank so much time extracting and trandorming the data) we are only gong to choose one... and we're going with the Autoencoder + HDBSCAN combination because it uniquely provides both rich anomaly detection capabilities through reconstruction error and effective clustering of normal flight patterns in a single model architecture, while maintaining interpretability through its latent space representations. This approach outperforms other models by simultaneously capturing both global flight patterns and local anomalies (such as unusual accelerations or trajectory deviations), and though it requires more computational resources during training, the quality of insights it provides justifies this tradeoff compared to simpler approaches.\n",
